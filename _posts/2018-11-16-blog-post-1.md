During a visit to the UNSW Smart City Research Area of the Urban Analysis Course Lab, I experienced an Augmented Reality Sandbox consisting of Kinect and a sand table, and conducted experiments on 5 interactive touch screens. With the help of relevant software, The population distribution and even the distribution of Mastercard users were visually discussed. Professor Zhang Wei expected team members of the visiting students to participate in software development and testing in the future.

At the 3D and VR Experiment Center of the University of New South Wales College of Art, I experienced the cutting-edge VR set and experienced the 2.5D virtual reality world with a pixel value of 116 million under the guidance of researchers. The professor said that this technology can be applied to medicine: through such a high-resolution three-dimensional display screen, you can observe the structure of DNA molecules and the gene map of the human body. The modern experimental equipment and interesting experimental process left a deep impression on me.
