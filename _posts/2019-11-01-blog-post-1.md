> Introducing of our method based on PReMVOS


The workshop at the 2019 ICCV [The 2nd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge](https://youtube-vos.org/challenge/2019/) was amazing, we won 9th on [the video object segmentation track](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20127). It is certainly not a satisfactory result compared to other teams, but we are still invited by the ICCV committee, we heared the methods and ideas of video object segmentation presentated by other teams.
