## What did I do

Tried the Simple Genetic Algorithm, implement the Crossover, Mutation part and found the issue of SGA.

Codes are available at: [https://github.com/LeslieWongCV/EE6227_Wong/tree/main/GenericAlgorithm](https://github.com/LeslieWongCV/EE6227_Wong/tree/main/GenericAlgorithm)

## Setup on which the code was tested
- python==3.7
- numpy==1.19.2 


## SGA
Simple Genetic Algorithm is one of the Evolution Algorithms, every step is just like the evolution process happening in nature. Crossover\Mutation\Reproduction\fitness value computation are conducted in the process.

### Features

1. The classic and the basic.
2. There are so many ways to do the Crossover and Mutation. PMX, OX1, OX2, POS, etc.


### Procedure

## Results

> Y = X^2  

<img src='/images/res02_SGA.png' width = '800' >
> Y = X * sin(10 * pi * X) + 2  


##  Issues

>  Sometimes it will go to local best. 


Simple Genetic Algorithm's result is strong relied on the initial population when the function of the problem has local minimal/maximal points.
