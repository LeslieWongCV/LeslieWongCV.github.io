The trip enlightened me about the research conducted at Liverpool John Moores University. Prof. Qian Zhang and Dingli Yu from the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering of Liverpool John Moores University also led me to visit their laboratory, introduced their research direction and described the research principles to me in a simple and understandable way. The tense atmosphere of the teachers' research project laboratory research team was impressive.

Then I went to Manchester and exchanged visits at the two schools. During the visit to the University of Salford, Theo Theodoridis, a teacher from [the Salford Innovation Research Centre (SIRC)](https://www.salford.ac.uk/research/sirc), introduced four types of robots: KUKA manipulators that perform slot milling, pneumatic muscle Biomimetic robotic arms, Artificial Intelligence-based ROS robots and help-aid robots to help the elderly with reduced mobility.
