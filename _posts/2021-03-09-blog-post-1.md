# EE6227
## Assignment 1
In this assignment, we compared several algorithms including: Differential Evolution, Self-Adaptive DE, Particle Swarm Optimization, Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer. We also verify the different hyper parameters. We found that CLPSO has a outstanding performance. Clearly, the results are related to the ω. Under ω = 0.85, CLPSO gives the better performance. In addition, PSO gives the best performance on the Function 1, 2, 4 and 9, 10. CLPSO has the best presentation on the leftover test functions. 

### Setup on which the code was tested
- python==3.6
- numpy==1.19.2

###  Issues
When using tournament selection to generate exemplars, instead of taking two particles and comparing them, we shuffled the p_best and chose the top %20 as the set for new exemplars, this measure accelerates the process and also has a good performance.
