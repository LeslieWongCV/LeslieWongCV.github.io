It was an honor to work as a research assistant under Prof. Xiaodong Cai of the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at University of Miami, where PhD seniors led me through the lab routines of weekly group meetings and close communication with research partners. Demanding as it may be to be immersed in doctoral topics from 7am to 10pm, I fully explored the intellectually intriguing studies and prepared myself for research-intensive projects.

Amid the process, I used R for data cleaning, and conducted signal categorization in terms of image processing (first turn signal into constellation diagram operations and then classify by finetuning the InceptionV3). During that time, I also got the chance to implement a lot of [projects](https://github.com/yashk2810/Image-Captioning) on GitHub related to image processing.

In addition to the research, there were also Tutorial and Workshop of Telecommunications which are also demanding.
