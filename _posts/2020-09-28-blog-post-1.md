> PanoAI is a company dedicated to the core development of artificial intelligence vision technology, combining the exploration of application scenarios with technological innovation.

A task of classifying 5 difference types of flower using Tensorflow was the first project.  And the dataset is stored as .tfrecord, so first I tried to get the images out of the .tfrecord file and plot the images of flowers*. I did this to see the feature of the data. Then I found that the dataset is used at Tensorflow tutorials, there are 3,670 total images.

*This could also be done by using the Tensorflow Generator, no need to put the data in a list and plot it.
